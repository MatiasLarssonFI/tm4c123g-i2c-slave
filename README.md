# TM4C123G as an IÂ²C slave

Some of the code is based on Quantum Leaps lessons (http://www.state-machine.com/quickstart/).
As can be seen, there's no Makefile or other project configuration files
on the master branch. I have only added the sources here because the goal
is to port this to GNU Arm. See the gnu-arm branch.
